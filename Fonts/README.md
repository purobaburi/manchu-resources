# Manchu Fonts

This directory collect various Manchu fonts acorss the internet.

## Xibe/Manchu (XM/稀满) FuYong

These fonts are provided by [Manchu Studies Group](https://www.manchustudiesgroup.org/typing-manchu/).

I've attempted to reconstruct the fonts' Chinese names and translate the meaning to English to give a preliminary impression of the font. I also used `fonttools`'s `ttx` to modify/fix some of the metadata in the fonts. The original fonts were named `Fu_XM_` followed by the font family's name, but I had changed it to `Manchu FuYong` for more descriptivity while honoring the font's author. The remaining metadata is left unchanged. Since metadata is typically not involved in the digital signature `DSIG` I have left them in place. I have also preserved the `.ttx` files so the new fonts could be "recompiled" should any changes be required. (Note: some of the incomplete license information that does not concern the Manchu script glyphs were purged.)

The `all_FuYong.zip` file contains all the fonts for ease of download. If the new font doesn't work on you device, you might want to try the old ones in `Miscellaneous/FuYong_XM_original.zip`. They should be functionally identical, with the exception of naming.
