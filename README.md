# Manchu Language Resources

The resources in this repository are not my own; I've just compiled the digital resources and pedagogical texts that I've come across. For that reason, I have not included a license–links and files belong to their respective owners. If you spotted any mistakes or have anything to contribute, please feel free to leave an issue :D

I want to extend my gratitude to the [Manchu Discord][manchu-discord-invite] and [tyotakuki][tyotakuki-github] for many of the resource suggestions.

### Jurchen Studies

The Jurchen language is widely considered the ancestor language of Manchu, historically spoken by the Jurchen people in northeastern China during the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234). It has a well-documented writing system similar to the Khitan scripts, both derived from Chinese characters.

- ＊ 今古文字集成 "The Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Characters" curates a [list of Jurchen characters](http://www.ccamc.co/jurchen_intro.php). These characters use the Unicode private sector to display, as they have not been officially inducted to the unicode standard.

### Fonts

**お知らせ・Warning**: Generally, fonts made specifically for Manchu will ensure that Manchu text is rendered correctly when inputted as-is. However, this is not the case in general. \[[Read more](/DigitalManchu/Unicode/README.md)\]

> The various positional and variant glyph forms of a letter are considered presentation forms and are not encoded separately. It is the responsibility of the rendering system to select the correct glyph form for a letter according to its context.

(_The Unicode® Standard: Version 15.0 – Core Specification_, chapter [13.5](/DigitalManchu/Unicode/Unicode-v15-ch13-Mongolian.pdf))

It is recommended that either a Manchu-specific font (in `MNCFonts`) be used or Unicode's `StandardVariations` be applied via Free Variant Selectors.

- [Fonts](/Fonts) specifically designed for the Manchu script/language.
- ＊ [Noto Sans Mongolian](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mongolian) – Standard font used by Wikipedia and many others. Should test behaviors of Mongolian Free Variation Selector unicode characters against this font.
- \[＊\] [**shenyileirob/hanshi**](https://github.com/shenyileirob/hanshi): a font designed to typeset Mongolian, Sibe, Manchu, and Manchu Ali Gali. Usage instructions (i.e., with Free Variant Selectors) are included for typesetting each of the aforementioned languages/scripts.
